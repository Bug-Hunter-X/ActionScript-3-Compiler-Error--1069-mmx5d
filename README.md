This repository contains an example of a common ActionScript 3 compiler error and its solution. The error, 1069: Syntax error: expecting semicolon before trace, occurs when a semicolon is missing before the trace statement. This is a relatively straightforward error to fix, but it is a good illustration of how syntax errors in ActionScript can be tricky to track down, especially in larger code bases.
